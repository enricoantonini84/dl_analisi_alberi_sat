\chapter{Introduction}
This research aims to analyze and build a method to identify the presence of trees and green areas from satellite images of urban areas, using machine learning models.
\\\\In recent years, the advent of artificial intelligence has begun to change the way we work and study, allowing us to carry out research and also generate audio/video media from a simple text typed in a prompt. These types of artificial intelligence, however, although based on very revolutionary LLM models, are general-purpose and work on natural language.
\\\\The idea is to use machine learning models that, by leveraging a computer vision algorithm, can quickly identify the presence of objects such as tree crowns or shapes for purposes like urban planning or to support green access indicators, such as the one defined by the 3-30-300 rule.
