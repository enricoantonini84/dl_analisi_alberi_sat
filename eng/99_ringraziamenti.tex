\chapter{Thanks}After so many pages of science, it is also necessary to insert a human page: my thanks.\\This is the concluding chapter of a journey that began in 2004 but, somehow, ended only in 2025: in some ways it was a real journey.\\\\First of all I have to thank my family, my wife Linda, my mother Carlina and my "second parents" Susanna and Aldo, because without them I would have been like a shipwreck in the middle of the sea at the mercy of differential equations, spherical capacitors and Fourier transforms. They helped me keep the bar straight ahead of the earth.\\\\I also thank Prof. Davide Quaglia, who was not only a supervisor but also a mentor, always available for an atypical student like me, who studied more at night than during the day.\\\\And then I can not but spend a word also for my supporters, my personal "Curva Sud", friends, colleagues and companions of a thousand adventures: Alberto R., Alberto S., Christian, Francesco, Manuel and Michele, who have followed me in all the successes and setbacks that I have had in this path, thank you very much.\\\\Well last but not least, thanks to my mascot Milo. Woof.
